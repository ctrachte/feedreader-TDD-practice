# Project Overview

In [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s 'Grow with Google - FEND' program I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), however, I was expected to revise and finish adding all necessary suites/specs.

# To Run this Project:

- Download the repository using `git clone` or by clicking the `clone or download button` for this repository
- Start `index.html` in your browser of choice
- Jasmine tests will automatically run, you can see the results at the bottom of the webpage.
- Edit and add tests to your heart's content in the `/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js` file!
